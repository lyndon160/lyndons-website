With regards to Lyndon's career aspirations, he's looking to find an organisation which gives me plenty of room to grow. He hope's to be working on high technology level research that has direct impact within industry or working on cutting edge development. He is eager to take on a role where he will have responsibility over an area of work, and looks forward to taking on the responsibility of managing a team.

In his spare time, he enjoys traveling, building things, game design, and cycling.
